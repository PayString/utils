## Usage

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- This enum was designed to remove "magic numbers" of HTTP status codes from our codebases. Instead, you can access a human-readable alias for any numeric HTTP status code using `HttpStatus.Status`.

```ts
import HttpStatus from '@xpring-eng/http-status'

console.log(HttpStatus.NotFound) // Logs 404
``` -->
