## Certificate and Key Test Files

For testing purposes. This directory contains a custom root CA key and cert,
an intermediate CA key and cert (signed by the root CA)
and an end client key and cert (signed by the intermediate CA).

Keys and certificates were generated by loosely following the instructions here:
https://www.flexlabs.org/2019/07/private-ca-1-building-root-and-intermediate-ca

All keys have a password for "payid" and expire in 30 years.
